# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The primary objective is to explore the e-commerce dataset using SQL techniques and functions to enhance our familiarity, understanding, and insights. However, the dataset requires significant cleaning and restructuring to improve its data quality. Our critical focus will be on conducting thorough cleaning, restructuring, and exploratory analysis. It is important to acknowledge that due to the existing limitations in data quality, obtaining high accuracy and actionable insights may pose challenges.

## Process
### STEP - 1: Load the data into pgadmin 4

### STEP - 2: Clean the data
Mostly focused on 
1) Type conversion
2) Missing/null values
3) Dropping empty columns
4) Renaming the columns
5) Removing duplicates
6) Data Validation
7) Data normalization

### STEP - 3: Work on [starting_with_questions.md](https://github.com/AkashKadia47/SQL-Project_1/blob/main/starting_with_questions.md)

### STEP - 4: Work on [starting_with_data.md](https://github.com/AkashKadia47/SQL-Project_1/blob/main/starting_with_data.md)

### STEP - 6: Work on [QA.md](https://github.com/AkashKadia47/SQL-Project_1/blob/main/QA.md)

## Results
I successfully answered the questions using advanced SQL formulas, showcasing my expertise in the language and its functions. Additionally, I sourced relevant and reliable data, ensuring data quality by efficiently parsing it. I identified and resolved potential issues related to data quality and quantity, ensuring the integrity of the data. Furthermore, I expanded beyond basic data-cleaning techniques to address additional data issues, including the capitalization of text. Lastly, I provided comprehensive comments on the code, adhering to best practices for variable names, syntax, and overall code readability.

## Challenges 
The project encountered several challenges. The lack of comprehensive documentation made it difficult to understand the data tables, resulting in cautious data-cleaning decisions and potentially limiting the significance of the analysis. Additionally, establishing a clear correlation between price, revenue, and product categories across different tables proved challenging due to data quality issues. The use of mathematical functions added complexity, and the limited background knowledge raised concerns about the accuracy of the results. Despite these challenges, collaboration with mentors and peers helped to gain insights and overcome obstacles, leading to valuable findings through thorough exploration and analysis of the available data.

## Future Goals
There are several important next steps to consider. The first priority is to address the data quality, structure, and documentation issues that are currently limiting the significance of future analyses. It is crucial to clarify a specific business problem that we aim to solve, as simply identifying trends from the data may not provide actionable insights without a clear application. From a technical perspective, it would be beneficial to establish composite keys between tables and explore regression techniques to predict customer behaviour and identify potential cross-selling opportunities. Additionally, investigating the factors contributing to the success or failure of specific products can provide valuable insights.

If I had more time, I would focus on streamlining the data cleaning process by implementing normalization forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF) to ensure better organization and eliminate redundancies in the tables. This would involve dividing the data into multiple tables based on their relationships, allowing for a clearer and more efficient data structure. By doing so, the overall data analysis process would become more straightforward and manageable.
